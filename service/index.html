                        <p class="description">Did you get here by searching for Charter Communications®, Time Warner Cable® (TWC®), or Bright House Networks®? After Charter purchased TWC and Bright House in 2015, the three telecom networks were combined under the name Spectrum.
                            Now Spectrum serves over 23.9 million customers in forty-one states.</p>
                        <p>This merger allowed Spectrum to deploy an impressive Wi-Fi network in public spaces. It also ensured a clearer HD picture, faster internet speeds without data caps, and unlimited calling without the extra fees many phone companies
                            charge. That’s good news for all customers, even if they’re coming from Charter, TWC, or Bright House.</p>
